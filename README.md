# PhoneConnector
WORK IN PROGRESS
</br>
</br>
This is an application that is esentially and android version of the windows phone app I used to connect to my local home computer. 
</br>
</br>
This app starts by connecting to a socket open on my local computer by the C++ application also located on my github called Server.
</br>
</br>
The android app with then send a command to intiate its intent to the server running on my local computer.
</br>
</br>
The local machine server will then process any further data sent from the android app and send back data if needed.
